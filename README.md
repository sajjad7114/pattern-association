# pattern-association
Here we use Hebb neural netwok.
We send pictures of characters A,B,C,D,E,J,K with 11*15 resolution as input and pictures with resolution 7*9 as output.
We try to teach the network with binary data (both noisy and no noisy pictures) to rebuild the patterns by looking at the high resolution picture, but we see that the pattern for a "C" character doesn't be rebuilt.
In conclution, Hebb network doesn't work well with binary data.
